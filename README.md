# deep-wfdb

**WFDB** (Waveform Database) was a python package created by MIT-LCP for reading the Physiobank's Database. 

## Physiobank Database 

Physiobank is a very rich source of data for physiological signals. 
This repository is made to make the WFDB library created by MIT-LCP becomes Deep Learning Compatible. 
Plotting in this would include `matplotlib` but will also be able to integrate with `plotly`.
